Project Title: FILE READER USING PYTHON GENERATORS

Description: 
Generators simplify creating iterators using the yield keyword. They produce items on demand, saving memory.

Features:
• Reads large files line by line.
• Filters by keyword.
• Memory-efficient.

How to Run:
python src/file_reader.py

Memory Efficiency : Memory efficiency is the practice of using computer memory, or RAM, in a way that minimizes waste and maximizes performance. It can be improved through strategies like efficient data storage, avoiding temporary data copies, and reclaiming unused memory. In a computing context, it's crucial for system stability, speed, and handling multiple tasks simultaneously. In a psychological context, memory efficiency can refer to the cognitive ability to selectively encode and recall important information.
